            <h3> PIM Project: Router with a cache using the Ada programming language. </h3>
            <p class="p3"> 
                I recently completed a project in which I designed and implemented a router with a cache using the Ada programming language. The router is responsible for forwarding data packets to their intended destinations, and the cache is used to store frequently accessed data in order to improve the overall performance of the system.

                The project required a thorough understanding of network protocols and data structures, as well as the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Ada. I faced several challenges throughout the project, such as implementing the cache eviction policy and debugging various issues with the routing algorithms.

                However, I was able to overcome these challenges through careful planning and testing, and the final product was a functional router with a cache that demonstrated improved performance compared to a traditional router without a cache. I am proud of the skills and knowledge I gained from this project, and I believe it will be valuable experience for future endeavors in the field of computer networking.

            <h3> Signal Treatment: A modem according to the V21 recommendation of the ITU using Matlab. </h3>
            <p class="p3">
                I recently completed a project on MATLAB in which I implemented a modem according to the V21 recommendation of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union). The modem is designed to transmit and receive binary data streams over a frequency-modulated signal.

                One of the main challenges of the project was constructing the frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulated signal. This involved generating a digital signal and scaling the temporal and frequency axes. I also implemented filters to demodulate the signal, using both low-pass and high-pass filters as well as an energy detector.

                In addition to demodulating the FSK signal, I also implemented a FSK demodulator that is able to handle synchronization errors. This involved using a cosine function to compare the received signal with the expected FSK frequencies, and adjusting the timing accordingly.

                Overall, this project required a thorough understanding of digital signal processing and filter design, as well as the use of MATLAB's built-in functions and tools. I am proud of the skills and knowledge I gained through this project, and I believe it will be valuable experience for future endeavors in the field of telecommunications.

            <h3> TOB: Short project of the game of 13 matches</h3>
            <p class="p3">
                In our object technology course, we were tasked with creating a game of 13 matches under certain conditions which included multiple strategy choices, an anti-cheating mechanism, and a method for cheating without being caught. The game has been completed and is fully functional at 100%, but it requires a graphical interface which I will implement later. This small project was a great opportunity to learn about the basics of object-oriented programming and to practice the use of the Java programming language.

            <h3> TicTacToe game with a graphical interface using Java programming language</h3>
            <p class="p3">
                I made this game for fun and to practice my Java programming skills. It is a simple TicTacToe game with a graphical interface. The game is fully functional and can be played by two players. I used the Java Swing library to create the graphical interface. I also used the Java AWT library to create the buttons and the labels.

            <h2> My Meeting With A Professional (MyJobGlasses)</h2>
            <p class="p3"> 
                I recently had meeting with Mrs Laurence to discuss my educational background and career. During the call, she shared insights about her own career journey and gave me advice on navigating the professional world. She emphasized the importance of developing a diverse set of skills and being adaptable to change. She also suggested that networking and building strong relationships with colleagues can be key to success in the workplace.

                She encouraged me to take on challenges and seek out opportunities for growth and development, and emphasized the value of continuous learning. She also shared some tips on how to effectively communicate and present oneself in professional settings. Overall, the call was very informative and gave me a lot to think about as I continue to explore my career options.
