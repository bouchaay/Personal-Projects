                Welcome to the Interests section of my engineering eportfolio. This section showcases my personal interests and hobbies outside of my academic and professional pursuits. Here, you will discover my passions and what drives me to continue to learn, grow, and develop as an individual. From sports and physical activities, music and performing arts to leisurely pursuits such as playing chess and spending time with friends, this section provides a well-rounded view of who I am as a person. My hobbies and interests not only help me to stay active and engaged, but also allow me to develop new skills, pursue my passions, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. I believe that having a diverse range of interests is important for personal growth and overall well-being and I invite you to explore this section to learn more about my personal interests and hobbies.
