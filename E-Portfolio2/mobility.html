            <h1>International Mobility</h1>
            <p class="p1">Not only does being bilingual improve your multi-tasking, it improves your decision making and problem solving skills. Languages improve your ability to think analytically so not only will you land your dream job, but you'll become a master at deciding where to eat.

            <h2> Deutsch (LV2) </h2>
            <p class="p3">German is an important language in fields such as science, technology, and business. Additionally, knowing German can provide access to a rich cultural heritage and open up opportunities for travel and study in German-speaking countries. At my school INP-N7, i'm currently learning to speak Deutsch and i'm making my knowledge about the german culture. Here is a video that i made to show you my progress in Deutsch and to get to know me better.</p>>

            <h2> English </h2>
            <p class="p2">
                English is the most widely spoken language in the world. It is the official language of 53 countries and is spoken by over 1.5 billion people. It is the language of business, science, technology, and diplomacy. It is the language of the internet, and the language of the United Nations. It is the language of the world.<br>
                In our English classes, we primarily focus on preparing for careers. In the first year, we concentrate on developing our communication skills through various means. Specifically, we learn how to create a professional resume, how to effectively chair and take minutes at a meeting, and how to engage in professional interactions. These skills are essential for anyone pursuing a successful career and we will work diligently to ensure our mastery of them.
            </p>

            <h2> Building A Resume </h2>
            <p class="p2">
                By comparing a French CV with an English resume, I acquired the skills to create a professional English resume. Personal information such as a photograph or address should not be included in an English resume. Moreover, depending on your work experience, you can create a multi-page resume. It is crucial to use the appropriate keywords for the job you are applying for. If you are interested, you can access my resume by clicking the button below.
