                Here at N7, we are committed to fostering a culture of sustainable development and innovation. One way we do this is through teamwork projects, where students work together to develop ideas and solutions for improving sustainable development at our school. Our current project focuses on raising awareness of sustainable development by considering different cases and needs, as well as developing innovative solutions to improve sustainable development at N7.

                We has been working hard to come up with the best solution for our chosen project area. We have gone through the process of brainstorming, idea selection, problem-solution identification, market analysis and pitch preparation.

                As we approach the final phase of the project, we are excited to present our idea to the jury and other teams on D-day. Our team members will be delivering the 2-minute pitch, highlighting the problem, solution, target population, market analysis, cost, profit, communication and launch strategy of our project.

                We are confident that our idea will make a difference if it vote.
